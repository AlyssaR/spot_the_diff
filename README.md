An engine intended to be able to: 
  - Spider, scrape, and save a given URL as a "known good"
  - Spider, scrape, and diff (on a schedule if desired) the same URL checking for changes and malicious insertions
  - Output a user friendly report of any changes made

Eventually I'd like to develop the scanner capabilities as well by adding the functionality of analyzing a site based on Yara signatures.
